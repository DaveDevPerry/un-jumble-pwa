# FUNjumble

<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->

A fun word game with three different game modes. Can you beat them all?

## Motivation

After seeing the quick success of Wordle, I wanted to create a simple game and try and release on the play store or something similar. I then converted it to a PWA to learn something new and post on the PWA store. Although not quite the success I was hoping for , at least it is a game that my family and I enjoy playing.

## Code

This was my first real project using React with hooks. React-router V6 and I also started using createContext and useReducer.
